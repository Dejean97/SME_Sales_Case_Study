# SME_Sales_Case_Study

This project (brief description)

Inspiration, and the data used, for this project came from the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship?ref=oiP3eujQmJmMY5YfG).

## Data Quality Assessment

### Brief

*Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.*

*Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.*

*The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:*

- *Customer Demographic*
- *Customer Addresses*
- *Transactions data in the past 3 months*

*You decide to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.*

### Task
Explore the data and draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.

This [precisely](https://www.precisely.com/blog/data-quality/data-quality-dimensions-measure) blog post was used as a framework to identify and measure data quality issues.
